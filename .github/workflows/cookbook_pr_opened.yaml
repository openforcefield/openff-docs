            This repository caches data generated from notebooks stored in other
            repositories in the `_cookbook_data_*` branches. Regenerating this
            cache takes about half an hour, so it is not done automatically in
            PRs. The current value of the cache from the `main` branch has been
            copied over to this PR's cache.


            To regenerate the cache for this PR, create a comment on this PR
            consisting only of the string:


            ```

            /regenerate-cache
            
            ```
